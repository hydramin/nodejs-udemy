# MVC Project Structure
- how to logically separate our code in the mvc pattern.
- Models are business logic, or the data we use
- Views are views
- Controllers integrate both, they uitilise the models and update the views
- Routes are used in the controllers.
## Reorganizeing the course project
- move the (req, res, next) middleware function into other js files under /controller/file.js files
- in the routes code the function ref is passed into the .get or .post routes, it is not executed.
## Creating Models
- the model is the product data model
- in productModel.js file export a class or a cosntructor function.
```js
exports = class Product {
    constructor(title) {
        this.title = title;
    }

// goes to db and fetches
    save() { }
    // fetches all from db
    fectchAll() { }
}
```
**if some of the functions deal with async function we pass in a callback function into the funcction then to the async function  or use a promise.**
